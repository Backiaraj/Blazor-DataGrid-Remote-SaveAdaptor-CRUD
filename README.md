# Blazor DataGrid - RemoteSaveAdaptor with CRUD

This example shows that how to bind local data and perform CRUD at server by using RemoteSaveAdaptor.

## Overview

To perform all Grid Actions (like paging, filtering, sorting) in client-side except the CRUD operations, that should be interacted with server-side to persist data. It can be achieved in Grid by using **RemoteSaveAdaptor**.

Datasource must be set to json property and set **RemoteSaveAdaptor** to the adaptor property. CRUD operations can be mapped to server-side using insertUrl, updateUrl, removeUrl properties.

### Architecture Overview

This is a Blazor hosted application with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Client** (`/Client`): Blazor WebAssembly frontend with the DataGrid UI and client-side data operations
- **Server** (`/Server`): ASP.NET Core backend with API endpoints for CRUD operations  
- **Shared** (`/Shared`): Shared data models and types used by both client and server

## Features

- **Hybrid Data Operations** – Client-side efficiency meets server-side persistence
- **Real-time Grid Interactions** – Instant UI updates for user actions
- **Sample Data** – Pre-populated with order records for testing
- **Syncfusion Components** – Industry-standard DataGrid with comprehensive features
